# Assignment 2: MinHeap and Performance Benchmark

## Project Description

This project implements the **MinHeap** data structure and performs **benchmarking** on its operations using arrays of different sizes. Additionally, performance graphs are generated using Python, based on the benchmarking results.

The project includes:
- Implementation of the **MinHeap** data structure in Java.
- A **Maven plugin** to execute Python scripts that generate performance graphs from benchmarking results.
- A **CSV file** with benchmarking results and a **PNG file** containing the performance graph.

## How to Run the Project

### Requirements

- **Java 8 or above**: For compiling and running Java code.
- **Python 3.x**: For executing Python scripts that generate the performance graph.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignment2-minheap-full.git
    cd assignment2-minheap-full
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for Java**:

   Make sure **Maven** is installed. To install the dependencies, run:

    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:

   Ensure that **Python 3.x** is installed. To install the required Python libraries, run:

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib pandas
    ```

### Running the Benchmark and Python Script

1. **Run the benchmark using Maven**:

   To run the Java code and perform the benchmarking, use the following command:

    ```bash
    mvn exec:exec
    ```

   This command will execute the Python script, generate the graph, and save it in the `docs` folder.

2. **Running the Python script manually**:

   If you want to run the Python script separately (for example, to regenerate the graph), run:

    ```bash
    python docs/plot_performance.py
    ```

   The graph will be saved as **`docs/performance_plot.png`**.

### Results

- **benchmark_results.csv**: The file contains benchmarking results, including execution time, swap counts, and comparison counts for various array sizes.
- **performance_plot.png**: The graph generated from the CSV file, showing the relationship between execution time and array size.

## Class Structure

### `PerformanceBenchmark.java`
This class runs the benchmarking using the **MinHeap** data structure and records the results in a CSV file, which is later used by the Python script for graph generation.

### `MinHeap.java`
Implementation of the **MinHeap** data structure, including operations like insert and extract-min.

### `PerformanceTracker.java`
A utility class that tracks performance metrics, such as the number of swaps, comparisons, and other metrics related to heap operations.

### `plot_performance.py`
A Python script that reads the benchmarking results from **benchmark_results.csv** and generates a performance graph.

## Maven Configuration

We use the **exec-maven-plugin** to run the Python script via Maven. This plugin allows us to execute any external program, such as a Python script, during the Maven build process.

The plugin in **`pom.xml`** is configured to execute the Python script when the `mvn exec:exec` command is run.

### Notes

If you wish to modify or enhance the code, feel free to open the relevant Java files in the `src/main/java` directory or the Python script in the `docs` folder. Make sure the project structure remains intact so that all paths and configurations continue to work properly.
